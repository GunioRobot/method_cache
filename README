MethodCache
===========

A Rails (v2.1.0) plugin that tries to solve the problem of having to call a method repetitively. That method is expensive to be recalculated everytime.
The solution is to cache the method results and we've always done that by caching a method's result in instance variables.

method_cache plugin frees you from the trouble of worrying about writing caching code and introduces a couple of utility methods
in ActiveRecord objects that make your life easier.

In its current form, the plugin provides the following extensions to ActiveRecord Objects

caches_method :method_name
caches_class_method :method_name
and for expiring the cache
instance.expire_method :method_name
Class.expire_instance_method :method_name, id
Class.expire_class_method :method_name
